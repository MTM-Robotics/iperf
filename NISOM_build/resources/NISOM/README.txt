This folder is intended to contain the NISOM cross-compiler install shell script(s).

These scripts are 10s to 100s of megabytes large, so they are not included in this source code repo. 
They can be downloaded from the Airbus Robotic main shared drive at:
X:\Engineering\Software\Cross Compilers\NISOM_Linux_Host

The current version of NISOM Linux requires the 2.0 script (which installs a GCC 2.4.2 cross toolchain):
